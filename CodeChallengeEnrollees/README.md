# Some salient features
  - Added pagination for the enrollee list (the pagination records are configurable per page)
  - Added a Delete button for future enhancement ,if a delete service does get implemented
  - A Search filter that allows to query on a record. The query will allow for Activation status search,
    any name search that one wants to pull up.
  - Details of a particular enrollee
  - Updating a particular enrollee (given that the Date of Birth and ID fields are readonly and cannot be edited)
    A Reset button that will clear the fields
    Field validation for Name,if empty
    Submit button is disabled if fields are blank on Form
  - At any point, user can navigate to the Enrollee list from the top menu bar (Enrollee list)
  - **ðŸ’°BONUS CHALLENGE**ðŸ’°: Also the Bonus challenge question has been fixed -
    It is a data issue with particular ID (Rand Miller).Essentially id field needs to be in format -
    89a0cd05-25fb-4b6e-a8f8-fc2187f690d0
    The problem was the id was present without the "-" that caused the server to error.
